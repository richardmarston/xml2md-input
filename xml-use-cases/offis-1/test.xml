            <description>This actor makes it possible to archive on-line data and to perform feedback analysis about

            <furtherInformation>In the pilot this actor represents the fact of having already average ratios of outages.
                One possible way to get these values is to analyse historical outages tickets (normally in the DMS-
                Distribution Management Systems) where information about the outages are stored (start/end times,
                equipment that failed, power shortage, number of client affected...)

    </Condition>
    <GeneralRemark>
        <content>The hypotheses/conditions under which the Use Case is developed are the following: The analysed MV
            network area is divided in small sections. These sub-sections are selected between two consecutive automatic
            Secondary Substations (SS). A simplified MV network representation is required in PSS/E to simulate each
            outage scenario (power flow calculations) Average rates of outages are needed to know the network
            performance of each area to identified critical zones. These values would be for example per SS
            (outage/100SS/year), underground lines (outages/100km/year) and aerial lines (outages/100km/year).
            Regulatory values are used to decide objective targets for simulation (penalties due to QoS). Through the
            results (graph of QoS vs Investment) a criterion of location for pieces of control equipment (automatic
            cabinets and telecontrol breakers at lines) is proposed. The proposed level of automation is taking into
            account by the responsible of each control zone to install the equipment. In Spain the Distribution of
            electricity is a regulated activity. The remuneration of DSO is charged on customers through the Access
            Tariffs. This tax joins different concepts. One of them is devoted to cover, theoretically, the distribution
            activity. The value is decided by the Ministry. From 2008, all DSO are subjected to the same procedure and
            legal conditions. The remuneration is individually assigned to each DSO taking into account issues such as:
            incentives per Quality of Service improvements, incentives to reduce the losses, valuation of overcast,
            effects to cover the foreseen demand and geographical restrictions. Each four (4) year the base value is
            fixed while yearly some parameters are corrected depending on the DSO performance. The architecture
            developed in the following section corresponds to the Use Case implementation within a DSO system
            architecture. However, in the PRICE pilot the approach has been simpler.

    </GeneralRemark>
    <Narrative>
        <completeDescription>Why? Requirements for increasing the level of automation in actual MV networks are rising
            currently. The relation between investment in automation and Quality of Service it is not linear. For
            example, the location of the same number of devices could lead to a variety of costs as well. Moreover,
            initial investment plans might be not affordable due to the actual economic crisis. Therefore, a simulation
            program to evaluate different scenarios is proposed to select a compromised point between costs, number of
            equipment and propose criterion to locate them. What expectation? / When It is expected a definition of a
            methodology to decide the level of automation in MV grids in a simplify manner. It would be based on a
            simulation algorithm taking into account investment on equipment in different types of SS and lines, power
            reinforcements and evaluation of their impact on the Quality of Service (TIEPI). It is intended to
            facilitate decisions during the network planning phase fulfilling technical, cost and regulatory
            constraints. What occurs? The main three steps in the process are: Use average values of outages (for
            example rate of outages in SS, lines, cables...) and cost units of work to install telecontrol equipment
            (cabinet at SS and breakers at lines) to increase the automation of the network. These data are managed by
            the DSO after analysing historical records collected in their systems. Simulation phase to evaluate
            different scenarios of outages over a simplified MV network portion Selection of compromise solution between
            cost and quality of service achieved
        </completeDescription>
        <shortDescription>Nowadays the operation of MV networks creates new challenges for automation. Coupling this
            with the worldwide economic situation, efforts for reaching a balance between Quality of Service indexes and
            investments in automation and grid reinforcement through simplify methods are worthy. This Use Case
            describes this process.
